                 Hey Dear, I'm JUDE JULIET CHIEMERIE, a proud Nigerian and a student of Mbara ozioma college of technology, Imo state, where I'm currently pursuing an OND Certificate  in Computer Software engineering technology. My journey into programming began with curiosity, and over time, I’ve developed a deep passion for it. Although I’m still learning, I’ve made significant strides and feel confident in my growing skills Computers and the concept of talking to them has always intrigued me and I’ve always been interested in tech, so joining the programming world was a great way for me to make the most of it. I started learning programming about a year ago, and after researching and learning about all the different programming fields, I found that web development is the one for me. I mentioned before that it took me a year or so to get to this point, but I had to keep stopping and starting due to some personal issues. Finally, I got back to it and I took it more seriously, so now I feel I’m capable of working on the front-end of a web development project. From my perspective, as someone who has a different background than computer science, I was completely new to the world of coding and programming. Because I believe in multi career and due to some political and geographical situations I wasn't able to work with my previous education, So I started teaching myself programming and I’m still working hard at it. ed

                <!-- <span id="more-text" style="display:none;">
                    I’m fluent in core web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m constantly exploring new ways to bring innovative web technologies and products to life. In addition, I have a keen interest in the blockchain space, a field that excites me for its potential to revolutionize industries.
                    
                    Whenever possible, I channel my enthusiasm into building projects using Node.js and modern JavaScript libraries and frameworks like React.js and Next.js. I’m always eager to expand my knowledge and push the boundaries of what I can create.

From my perspective, as someone who has a different background than computer science, I was completely new to the world of coding and programming. I had a bachelor’s in media and communication, but then my love of numbers led me into the world of accounting, so I got an international certification in finance. Because I believe in multi career and due to some political and geographical situations I wasn't able to work with my previous education, So I started teaching myself programming and I’m still working hard at it.
